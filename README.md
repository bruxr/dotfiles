# Brux' dotfiles

Heavily based on the dotfiles of [paul](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) and [mathias](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). Check out their dotfiles first as they are much more complete than mine.

## How to install
Running `setup.sh` will copy over the dotfiles from this repo to your home directory. It will also set some OS X defaults, see `.osx` for what these settings are.
